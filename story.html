			              Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, an unprecedented number of people have been trying to navigate the unemployment system. Many have found the experience frustrating. With millions of newly unemployed people seeking benefit information at the same time, the system is understandably overloaded. Information available online can be confusing, and it is difficult to reach agents by phone. This bot helps direct people toward useful resources and is intended to ease the application process.
			            </p>
			            <p class="text">
			              BEBO was developed in May 2020, during a week-long hackathon <a href="https://www.theexpatwoman.com/hackathon/">(“Women Hack the Crisis” hosted by The Expat Woman in San Francisco, CA.)</a> Team WHOW (Women Helping Other Women) built the first version in a week. 
			            </p>

			            <p class="text">
			            Of the millions of jobs that have been lost in this crisis, the majority were held by women. In certain industry sectors <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90488089/women-are-disproportionately-impacted-by-covid-19">women have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 related job losses</a>. Women of color, immigrants, caretakers, single moms, and non-native English speakers have been particularly impacted. We hope this bot will help those in our community who are most vulnerable to get the answers they need.
